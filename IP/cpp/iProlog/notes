Roadmap to iProlog with 4K of RAM, 32K of flash

Goal: "Soft-realtime Natural Language Logic Programming on a Picosatellite"

Bugs: indexing isn't working the same as in the Java code, slowing it

Speedups: go back to spine stack rather than ptr array to Spines because
	  "new" is eating up cycles

Get relative addressing working
   - besides speedup, may make binary code more compressible
   - LZ4 (about 2x) approaches RAM memcpy speed

Put dload et al. in separate C++ class or prog.h/cpp
   - don't need its buffers
   - download ASCII opcodes to MSP/CC430

Try to make unfold & unify[_args] "stackless"
   - stacks needed to be threaded into heap:
	- C++ code stack
	- ustack
	- spine stack

Dispense with indexing, at least at first
   - implement as callbacks, for full orthogonality
   - custom indexer?
   - how to "heapify" it?

Try compression
   - probably need new "opcode" to trigger inflate
   - larger (32K) code space enables dictionary compression
   - but split of flash/RAM adddress space a problem

Try 16-bit cells

Binary output from compiler
   - endianess perhaps indicated in a header
   - LZ4 compression

Find out whether CC430 can write to its own flash
   - if so, and the address space issue issue can be solved
     look at how initial logic-programming code can be put in flash
     to free up RAM -- split heap, a little hairy

"Garbage collect" initialization code for logic programs?
   - need some control flow analysis to be sure of
     what to dump and how soon to dump it

------------------------------------------------------------

vmaps - vector of IntMaps
   v = "variable" or "value"?

   index(clauses, vmaps):
    for i 0.. < length of all clauses c
      put(IMap[] imaps, IntMap[] vmaps, int keys[](=c.xs), int val=i+1)
                                                          // $$$ UGLY INC
	clause's xs (int array of deref'd cells--"index vector")
	for i = 0 to < length of imaps
	  if key[i] not 0 (0 is "marking variable positions")
	     put key,val pair in imaps at pos = i
	       (so i is the clause number=clause index+1?)
	         IMap::put allocates a new Integer(key) for hash
		 key is from deref'd cells in head
		 clauses[val-1] is the clause that has that cell
	  else ("variable position")
	     add key,val pair to IntMap at i in vmaps
	     so "vmaps" is var maps
	--could all be done with index into clauses + val param
	 so for each clause, it's
	    mapping
	      from 
	        a unique Integer object
	          created from the deref'd cell value
	      to
	        the clause /number/
	 (starting at 1, i.e., not to its off-by-1 /index/ in clauses[])

	 "keys":: "the index vector containing dereferenced constants,
	  numbers or array sizes as extracted from the outermost
	  term of the head of the clause, with zero values
	  marking variable positions."
  iprolog:
     just passes clauses[i].index_elts and val Int(i+1)

int[] IMap get(int[] keys -- deref'd cells)
     for i = 0 to < length of imaps (== # of clauses?)
                                    what if len > len of keys???
				    maybe this can't happen--
				    imaps length <= MAXIND?
        if not a variable cell (key[i] != 0)
          make an IntMap
	    with new Integer
	      based on key=deref'd cell
	 (I guess this will always make a new IntMap)
	add it to "ms"
	add vmaps[i] to "vms"
     make IntMap vectors ims of ms.size, vims of vms.size
     initialize IntMaps of ims from ms.get(i)
     initialize IntMaps of vims from vms.get(i)

     make cs = IMap's intersection of ims and vims
     from each in cs
        subtract 1 where (presumably) the $$$ UGLY INC added
     sort the result
     return it

cell2index does a getRef -- maybe bad news for the idea
of relative addressing in heap cells
	  
pp.11-12 of paper:

"For each argument position in the head of a clause (up to a maximum
that can be specified by the programmer) ..."

     MAXIND

"...it associates to each indexable element (symbol, number or arity)...

     C,N,A

"...the set of clauses where the indexable element occurs in that argument
position."

     cell sub-type: indexable_elt

"For deep indexing, the argument position can be generalized to be the
integer sequence defining the path leading to the indexable element in
a compound term."

     hence "leader"? (Or does he even do this?)

"The clauses having variables in an indexed argument position are also
collected in a separate set for each argument position."

     vmaps

"Sets of clause numbers associated to each (tagged) indexable element are
supported by an IntMap implemented as a fast int-to-int hash table (using
linear probing)."

     clause_no type?
     indexable_elt -> {clause_no*}

"An IntMap is associated to each indexable element by a HashMap."

     Is this where Integer comes in?

"The HashMaps are placed into an array indexed by the argument position
to which they apply."

   vector<IMap> imaps

"When looking for the clauses matching an element of the list of goals
to solve, for an indexing element x occurring in position i, we fetch
the set C[x,i] of clauses associated to it."

   Presumably including the functor ("predicate name") of the clause...
   See below.

"If V[i] denotes the set of clauses having variables in position i,
then any of them can also unify with our goal element."
/usr/bin/bash: }fmt: command not found

"Thus we would need to compute the union of the sets C[x,i] and V[i] for
each position i,..."

    Why?

"...and then intersect them to obtain the set of matching
clauses. We will not actually compute the unions, however. Instead,...

"...for each element of the set of clauses corresponding to the
“predicate name” (position 0), we retain only those which are either
in C[x,i] or in V[i] for each i > 0."

   the ms/vms in index()?

"We do the same for each element for the set V[0] of clauses having
variables in predicate positions (if any)."

   "predicate positions" meaning in the predicate name position?

"Finally we sort the resulting set of clause numbers and hand it over
to the main Prolog engine for unification and possible unfolding in case
of success."

   Is the sort order an optimization?
