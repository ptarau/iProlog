/**
 * "representation of a clause" (P.Tarau)
 * 
 * [MT]: I decided to pair my API-built in-RAM binary form
 * with Tarau's original, which can hold unfolded
 * programs.
 *   The members "functor", "args", and
 * "body" can be imported into, and exported from,
 * his "compiled assembly language" representation.)
 * In fact, these cleanly map one-for-one, as far
 * as I can tell (i.e., the origina not-unfolded code
 * can be decompiled from his compiled form), but
 * I'll cross that bridge (if it looks sturdy enough)
 * when I come to it.
